### 문제 설명

<p>A mad scientist performed a series of experiments, each having n phases. During each phase, a measurement was taken, resulting in a positive integer of magnitude at most k. The scientist knew that an individual experiment was designed in a way such that its measurements were monotonically increasing, that is, each measurement would be at least as big as all that precede it. For example, here is a sequence of measurements for one such experiment with n=13 and k=6:</p>

<pre>1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6</pre>

<p>It was also the case that n was to be larger than k, and so there were typically many repeated values in the measurement sequence. Being mad, the scientist chose a somewhat unusual way to record the data. Rather than record each of n measurements, the scientist recorded a sequence P of k values defined as follows. For 1 ≤ j ≤ k, P(j) denoted the number of phases having a measurement of j or less. For example, the original measurements from the above experiment were recorded as the P-sequence:</p>

<pre>2, 7, 7, 8, 12, 13</pre>

<p>as there were two measurements less than or equal to 1, seven measurements less than or equal to 2, seven measurement less than or equal to 3, and so on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the scientist eventually went insane, leaving behind a notebook of these P-sequences for a series of experiments. Your job is to write a program that recovers the original measurements for the experiments.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains a series of P-sequences, one per line. Each line starts with the integer k, which is the length of the P-sequence. Following that are the k values of the P-sequence. The end of the input will be designated with a line containing the number 0. All of the original experiments were designed with 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 26.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each P-sequence, you are to output one line containing the original experiment measurements separated by spaces.</p>
