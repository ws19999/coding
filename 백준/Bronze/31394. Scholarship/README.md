### 문제 설명

<p>At last the first term at the University came to its finish. Android Vasya has already passed all the exams and wants to know if he gets a scholarship. There is the following practice of giving scholarship to students at the University:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if a student has got satisfactory marks, the scholarship is not given,</li>
	<li>if a student has passed through the examination period with only excellent marks, he gets a personal scholarship,</li>
	<li>if a student doesn't get a personal scholarship and his average mark is not less than $4.5$, he gets a high scholarship,</li>
	<li>if a student gets neither high nor personal scholarship and doesn't have satisfactory marks, he gets a common scholarship.</li>
</ul>

<p>A satisfactory mark corresponds to value 3, a good mark corresponds to value 4, and an excellent mark corresponds to value 5. An average mark for a student is the average value of all the marks this student got in his exams.</p>

<p>Help Vasya find out which scholarship he gets.</p>
