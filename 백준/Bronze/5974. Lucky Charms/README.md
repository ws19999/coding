### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie has a lovely charm bracelet whose length is L (4 <= L <= 32,768) mm.  Hanging from this bracelet are C (1 <= C <= 512) charms, each at a unique integer distance from the bracelet's left side. Charm i dangles on the end of a string whose length is S_i mm (1 <= S_i <= 25) and which is located P_i (0 <= P_i <= L) mm from the bracelet's left side.</p>

<p>Margaret snatches the bracelet from Bessie and nails it (with a zero-width nail) to a fencepost. The nail is located N mm (1 <= N <= L-1) from the left side of the bracelet, and the bracelet itself thus hangs left and right of the nail, with gravity pulling the bracelet and charms straight down.</p>

<p>Bessie is curious: How far is each charm from the nail in the fencepost?</p>

<p>By way of example, consider a bracelet of length 16 mm with three charms. The schematic diagram below shows + signs which are each separated by 1 mm and vertical bars which each represent 1mm of an attached string. The charms are defined to be 4, 7, and 3 mm from<br>
the bracelet.</p>

<pre>                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

                      |
                      *</pre>

<p>When the bracelet is nailed to the fencepost with the nail at location 5, it droops like this (please ignore the left-right spread which is shown for clarity):</p>

 13                     |
 14                     *</pre>

<p>As you can see, the first charm droops down 5 mm from the nail; the second charm droops to 11 mm and the third charm all the way down to 14 mm from the nail.</p>

<p>Calculate the charm droop distance for each charm given.</p>
