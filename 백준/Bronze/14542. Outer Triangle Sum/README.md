### 문제 설명

<p>You are to find the sum of the outer number of an isosceles right triangle.</p>

<p>For example, for n = 5 the isosceles right triangle grid are filled with non-negative integers that are less than 100:</p>

<pre><strong>5   </strong>
<strong>1</strong>   <strong>8</strong> 
<strong>9</strong>   6  <strong>1</strong> 
<strong>2</strong>   7  2  <strong>6</strong> 
<strong>3   5  7  8  9</strong></pre>

<p>The sums of the outer integers are calculated as below:</p>

<p>sum = 5 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 1 + 8 = 64</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a few test cases. For each test case, the first line of input is a positive integer <strong>n (n <= 10) </strong>that determines the dimension of the triangle. Each of the next <strong>n </strong>lines contains 1 to <strong>n </strong>integers respectively that will fill the isosceles right triangle. Input is terminated by a case where <strong>n </strong>is 0.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Each line of output will start with “Case #:” where # is replaced by the case number. Then you have to output the sum of the outer numbers of the triangle.</p>
